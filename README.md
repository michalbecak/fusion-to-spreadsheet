fusion-to-spreadsheet
=====================
AppScript for making union of more fusion tables into spreadsheet, optimized for purpose of georeferencer pilot.
To start using it, create 2 blank spreadsheets (one for maps fusion tables, second for versions fusion tables), create fusion table, that will contain info about all other fusion tables (like this: https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1GVXyJu4M_PhHkouLGEMaKzxECGNI_ZBABlhpev4), change 3 lines of configuration section, so they will contain IDs of your newly created 3 tables and it's done.
Code is based on Fusion-To-Spreadsheet script by John McGrath (https://github.com/jomcgrath2/Fusion-to-Spreadsheet).
